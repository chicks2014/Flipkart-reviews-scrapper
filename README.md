 - Flask is a light-weight web framework for Python
 - Easy to work with (Same syntax as of Python)
 - While Flask addresses itself as a "micro-framework", it is not lacking in features or power, especially with a clutch of extensions to support features such as authentication, databases and so on
 - Comprehensive documentation available
